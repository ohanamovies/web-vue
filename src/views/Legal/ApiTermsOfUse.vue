          <h2>2. Commercial Use</h2>
          <h3>RULES AND RESTRICTIONS</h3>
          <p>
            {{ products }} are offered for free. If you want to use our data for your own
            application, you can only do so for non commercial applications, and after receiving
            written approval from one official member of {{ entity }}.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the primary purpose of your application is to derive revenue, it is considered a
            commercial application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The {{ products }} rely on data from other sources (e.g.: movie posters or titles). So
            if you were interested in using {{ entity }} data in your own applicaiton, you must
            <router-link to="/contact-us">contact us</router-link> first, so we can clarify which
            data we can offer and which one not. As a rule of thumb, assume we only own the data
            about movie scenes: their start and end time, and their tags.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 70%">
            Note: this will be detailed further in the future to avoid the need of manual approvals.
