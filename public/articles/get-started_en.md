[Find movies](/find-movies)

To help you find a good clean movie we use a set of icons to let you known if (based on your personal settings) a movie / show can be watched safely.

**Clean:** Content was originally safe, it didn't need to be edited.  
**Edited:** There was unwanted content, but we will skip it all for you.  
**Unsafe:** Unwanted content was flagged, but movie hasn't been edited yet.  
**Unknown:** We can't help as we don't have information yet.

You will see these colors, in multiple places:

1.  In the [movies](/find-movies) section of this website.
2.  In the browser section of the content providers (like Netflix).
3.  In the Chrome toolbar: the Ohana icon will be replaced by the filtering status icon when watching a movie

#### Step 4. Enjoy the movie!

Grab some popcorn an enjoy the movie! We will skip any unhealthy content for you!

#### Step 5. Pro tip
