What is Ohana?
--------------

![](images/means-family.jpg)

Ohana is an open community of families and movie fans like you that share a passion for great healthy movies.

Ohana is the Wikipedia of movie values and content filters, providing free access to tools, data and knowledge that enable its users to easily find and enjoy movies in a healthy way.

Our Chrome extension embeds itself within Netflix, HBO, etc. enabling users to skip those scenes they do not want to watch. With Ohana you decide what to watch and what to skip!

If you enjoy great movies, but don't like watching unhealthy scenes, you will be pleased to meet Ohana.




Why be active about what to watch?
---------------------------

#### Values

It is no secret that many movies come with a set of values and ideas that they promote. These can be either toxic like sexism, racism, revenge... or healthy positive values like social justice, women's rights, self-giving loveâ€¦ The younger the audience, the easier these ideas shape our own world-view, but no studies show that no one is immune to a constant bombardment of toxic content. Post-film discussions and reflections can greatly change the impact, helping us understand what tricks the producers used to promote their ideas, as well as why what they promote is good, healthy and valuable, or why it is an unhealthy world-view.


#### Graphic content

In some cases, it is not about the ideas, but about the graphic or explicit content depicted in the movie. Here it does not matter how mature the viewer is, nor how much discussion you have afterwards. Watching the scene itself is unhealthy. This can be due to different reasons:

+ Love not use. We believe people should be loved, not used. We want to approach sex as a way of showing love/giving ourselves to the other person. Thus we try to avoid using other people (either physically or on a video) as a tool to obtain pleasure.
+ Disturbing scenes. Unpleasant, terrifying, disgusting ... We can filter all kinds of content, having a special mention in being able to avoid also: - Content for those with addictions (problems with gambling, alcohol, pornography ...). - We can also remove those scenes that contain phobias or topics that can affect people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and can trigger flashbacks.
+ Profanity....


Why are we here? (Vision)
-------------------------

> We have a dream that one day movies will promote a healthy lifestyle.

1.  We have a dream that one day everyone will be able to seamlessly filter out unwanted content **\[avoiding the bad\]**
2.  We have a dream that one day the internet will promote the access and creation of movies with healthy values **\[promoting the good\]**
3.  We have a dream that one day bad content will be turned into an opportunity to learn & discuss about the good stuff **\[transforming the bad into good\]**
4.  We have a dream that one day this spirit will jump into the broader society **\[to infinity and beyond\]**

What do we do?
------------------------

1.   We allow people to skip scenes, by providing a chrome extension that enables users to filter out the scenes they do not want to watch. Tools to skip graphic or explicit content on movies and tv series.

2.  We help people find good content Web search on our website Adding extra layer to different platforms (eg. on Netflix, justwatch... add icon with type of content) Link content from different sources ([Kids-In-Mind](https://kids-in-mind.com/), [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/), parents guide...)

3.  We promote the creation of healthy movies. By giving visibility to healthy content By bringing the discussion about content to the public

4.  We promote discussion. We use meaningful tags (abuse, consent, fidelity...). We clarify reasons not to watch scenes (bad example, disturbing, using vs loving...). We create content (videos, blogs...) to promote the discussion (eg this video). Linking resources on other projects ([cor project](https://corproject.com/), pure in heart...)

5.  We pave the way for future projects by providing an open API where people can find good content and access filters



How is Ohana organised
-----------------------

We have a small hard working team developing the tools, fine tuning the user experience...

A larger group of editors and volunteers, creating content such as classifying movie values, providing reviews and creating scene filters

A larger group of users, families and movie fans, that enjoy watching great healthy movies. Their biggest contribution is using Ohana to enjoy great healthy movies (purpose) but, whenever possible, they also contribute financially to the project.
