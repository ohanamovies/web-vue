## What is Ohana?

![](images/means-family.jpg)

Ohana is a community of families and movie fans like you that share a passion for good healthy movies.

As a community, we develop a set of tools to help people watch movies without having to worry about annoying or innapropiate content they don't want to watch (sex scenes, violent content, etc.)

Our Chrome extension embeds itself within Netflix, HBO, etc. enabling users to skip those scenes they do not want to watch. With Ohana you decide what to watch and what to skip!

If you enjoy great movies, but don't like watching unhealthy scenes, you will be pleased to meet Ohana.

## Why deciding what to watch?

Why do you want to skip scenes? Isn't that censorship? They are many reasons people might want to skip scenes...

#### Educational purposes

Some scenes depict morally wrong behaviours as good (eg. the cool guy is the drug dealer/sex abuser/...), this pushes kids (and everyone really) to see those actions as good.

#### Using vs loving

We believe people should be loved, not used. We want to approach sex as a way of showing love/giving ourselves to the other person. Thus we try to avoid using other people (either physically or on a video) as a tool to obtain pleasure.

#### Disturbing scenes

Unpleasant, terrifying, disgusting ... We can filter all kinds of content, having a special mention in being able to avoid also: - Content for those with addictions (problems with gambling, alcohol, pornography ...). - We can also remove those scenes that contain phobias or topics that can affect people with post-traumatic stress disorder and can trigger flashbacks.

## Why are we here? (Vision)

> We have a dream that one day the Internet (and watching movies in particular) will help people discover family values.

1.  We have a dream that one day everyone will be able to seamlessly filter out unwanted content **\[avoiding the bad\]**
2.  We have a dream that one day the internet will promote the access and creation of movies with good values **\[promoting the good\]**
3.  We have a dream that one day bad content will be turned into an opportunity to learn & discuss about the good stuff **\[transforming the bad into good\]**
4.  We have a dream that one day this spirit will jump into the broader society **\[to infinity and beyond\]**

## What do we do? (Mission)

1.  We allow people to skip scenes, by providing a chrome extension that enables users to filter out the scenes they do not want to watch.
2.  We help people find good content Web search on our website Adding extra layer to different platforms (eg. on Netflix, justwatch... add icon with type of content) Link content from different sources (kids-in-mind, commonsense media, parents guide...)
3.  We promote the creation of good content By giving visibility/publicity to good content By bringing the discussion about content to the public
4.  We promote discussion We use meaningful tags (abuse, consent, fidelity...) We clarify reasons not to watch scenes (bad example, disturbing, using vs loving...) We create content (videos, blogs...) to promote the discussion (eg this video) Linking resources on other projects (cor project, pure in heart...)
5.  We pave the way for future projects By providing an open API where people can find good content and access filters
