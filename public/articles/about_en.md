What is Ohana?
--------------

![](images/means-family.jpg)

Ohana is an open community of families and movie fans like you that share a passion for great healthy movies.

Ohana is the Wikipedia of movie values and content filters, providing free access to tools, data and knowledge that enable its users to easily find and enjoy movies in a healthy way.

Our Chrome extension embeds itself within Netflix, HBO, etc. enabling users to skip those scenes they do not want to watch. With Ohana you decide what to watch and what to skip!

If you enjoy great movies, but don't like watching unhealthy scenes, you will be pleased to meet Ohana.




Why be active about what to watch?
---------------------------

#### Values

It is no secret that movies, as an expression of the human spirit, portray a world-view and a set of values (social justice, women's rights, self-giving love... but also sexism, racism, revenge...). Some key ideas:

+ The younger the audience, the easier these ideas shape our own world-view, but studies show that no one is immune to a constant bombardment of toxic content.
+ Post-film discussions and reflections make us aware of the promoted values. Changing (or inverting) the influence of the movie, and if we change our world view, making it a conscious decision.
+ Positive values do not mean simplistic or easy to watch. A movie about genocides or sexual abuses might be disturbing, showing the worse humans can do... but if it is respectful and condemns the actions, while maybe showing examples of healing or repentance and reconciliation. While peaceful animation movies might promote any kind of ideology.



#### Graphic content

In some cases, it is not about the ideas, but about graphic or explicit content depicted in the movie. Here it does not matter how mature the viewer is, nor how much discussion you have afterwards. Watching the scene itself is unhealthy. Some reasons for this might be:

+ Graphic violence & gore. Depending on your sensitivity, these scenes can ruin a good movie, or trigger flashbacks on people suffering from trauma...
+ Sex & nudtiy. If you believe people should be loved, not used; and want to approach sex as a way of showing love/giving yourself to the other person. Thus we try to avoid using other people (either physically or on a video) as a tool to obtain pleasure.


How do you plan to help people?
--------------
In Ohana we want to:
1. Promote creation, visibility and ease of access to good movies
2. Give everyone the freedom to skip unwanted graphic or explicit scenes
3. Promote discussion and awareness about movies & values

We do so with two key principles in mind:
1. Freedom. You decide what to watch and what to skip
2. Community. We are no big corporation, but a community of users. This gives us the freedom to care about good quality content (instead of profit), while providing free access thanks to the collaboration and donations of our community.

What do you do to help?
--------------
In particular, we:

1. Run this website with movie recommendations based on users preference (style, type of scenes to remove...)
2. Provide information about values and graphic or explicit content on movies
3. Promote discussion by providing reviews and resources for post-film discussions, helping people dig deeper...
4. Allow people to skip scenes, by providing a chrome extension that enables users to filter out the scenes they do not want to watch. Tools to skip graphic or explicit content on movies and tv series.
5. Add an extra layer to different platforms (eg. on Netflix, justwatch... add icon with type of content)
6. Promote the creation of healthy movies. By giving visibility to healthy content By bringing the discussion about content to the public
7. Pave the way for future projects by providing an open API where people can find good content and access filters



How is Ohana organised
-----------------------

We have a small hard working team developing the tools, fine tuning the user experience...

A larger group of editors and volunteers, creating content such as classifying movie values, providing reviews and creating scene filters

A larger group of users, families and movie fans, that enjoy watching great healthy movies. Their biggest contribution is using Ohana to enjoy great healthy movies (purpose) but, whenever possible, they also contribute financially to the project.
